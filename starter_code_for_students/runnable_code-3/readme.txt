In case the csv file does not show the data, my data came from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities

I used the command python3 (filename) for every python script I wanted to use as I put a line at the end of each file that was meant to run the ability to run.

clean_diabetes.py is the cleaning script for the diabetes.csv file and clean_diabetes.csv is the cleaned data after doing the ETL process on the data.

final_decision_vis.py is the file that demonstrates a single decision tree as the underlying model visual, while kfold.py is the file that creates the 5 images to demonstrate the kfold for 5-fold cross validation using all the data, and a single decision tree as the underlying model.
